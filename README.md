# SpringBot


### Run the App
1.	It is a short version of WaterBot
2.	H2 embedded (inmemory) database is used for data storage as well as to save time of development, minimize resources and to display one of Spring Boot features. Certainly, on a real app it is preferred to use the external SQL database for the further extension.
3.	It is based on Spring Boot, one of the most popular frameworks.
4.	The app has been uploaded on the free cloud storage for its further testing.

The following are my recommendations on the app features:
1.	Take into account a user’s weight, age and activity level
2.	Calculate recommendations based on a user’s personal details
3.	Adjust a user’s data according to their current activity level
4.	Take into consideration secondary water sources such as vegetables (as we know they consist of 70-95% of water), milk, yoghurt, etc.
